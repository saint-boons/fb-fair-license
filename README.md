# FB FAIR LICENSE

### Welcome to the license repository

This license was created so that creators do not fear someone taking their work (modified or not) and making a profit from it. 

All software under the license is still free to use, copy, distribute, and modify.

# How to use the license?
1. Create a `LICENSE` file in your repo.
2. Paste the `LICENSE` in this repo file contents in yours.
3. Change ONLY the following info:
- <year> to the current year (e.g.: 2021)
- <full name> to the name you go by (e.g.: frenchbones, e.g.: Elon Musk) avoid nicknames, if not comfortable sharing your real name, use online name, but not an acronym of it.
- <contact email> to your email if someone wishes to contact you (e.g.: frenchbones@outlook.com).


### Q&A

**Q:** Why is it called the `FB FAIR LICENSE`?

**A:** It is called like so because, `FB` stands for FrenchBones *(my online name)* I'm not a narcissist to the point of naming it after my full name so I just rolled with my initials, `FAIR` because I feel like it's pretty fair for the original creator and it allows them to have a piece of mind, and `LICENSE` because it is a license.

**Q:** Why was this created?

**A:** This was created so I could control my projects a little more, and how people modify, use them, *Bla Bla Bla*... I've always liked the idea of open-source software, but I didn't like how most licenses give crazy freedom.

**Q:** Can I use it?

**A:** Yes you can.

**Q:** What are the main goals?

**A:** It just makes sure that:
1. Modders can't make a profit off of the original work (with fiat or crypto).
2. Proper credit is given & original work recognised.
3. Malicious code spread.
4. It promotes collaboration with as least branches as possible.
